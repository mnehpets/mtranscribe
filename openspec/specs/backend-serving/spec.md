## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change implement-oneserve-backend. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Serve Frontend SPA
The backend MUST serve the compiled frontend application static files.

#### Scenario: Root Request
Given the backend is running
When a user requests `GET /`
Then the server redirects the user to `/u` with status 302 (Found) or 301 (Moved Permanently).

#### Scenario: Static Asset Request
Given the backend is running
When a user requests `GET /assets/style.css`
Then the server returns the CSS file contents with correct MIME type.

#### Scenario: SPA Client Routes
Given the backend is running
When a user requests `GET /u/some-route`
Then the server returns the contents of `index.html` with status 200.

#### Scenario: No Generic Fallback
Given the backend is running
When a user requests `GET /non-existent-route`
And `/non-existent-route` does not start with `/u/`
And it is not a valid static file
Then the server returns 404 Not Found.
